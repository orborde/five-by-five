# Assumptions the guesser could make about the cluer

- Randomly picking from a uniform distribution over words
- As above, but from some distribution that is a Nash equilibrium for
  the "tries to make it as hard as possible" and "adjusts guessing
  patterns to find the answer more easily" game.
- Min/Max: assume the cluer perfectly predicts the guesser's actions
  in response to clues, and so the guesser tries to minimize the
  worst-case number of guesses required.
